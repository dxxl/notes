### NUTRITION
      * SIX ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS
            - WATER: Dissolves and carries nutrients 
                  - Anything that has water is water
            - PROTEIN: Builds new tissues
            - CARBOHYDRATES: Provides energy
            - FAT: Provides long-term energy, insolation, etc.
            - VITAMINS: Facilitate use of other nutrients
                        * TYPES OF VITAMINS
