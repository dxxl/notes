### FAMILY
      * Mary and Joseph help us to understand the life of Jesus and the need to develop and deepen our spiritual life
      * A quiet, disciplined lifestyle helps us to see the need for simplicity, humility of spirit, for detachment from material things
      * The family which is founded and given life by God, is a community of persons of husband and wife, of parents and children, of relatives
      * Without love the family is not a community of persons and, in the same way, without love, the family cannot live, grow and perfect itself as a community of people.
