### INCARNATION
      - embodied in flesh; in human form
      - The belief that Jesus Christ, as the second person of the trinity, God the Son of the Logos (Word)
        'became flesh' by being conceived in the womb of a women, The virgin Mary
      
      - Expitation = making of amends for a wrong has done
            - When John says the "Word became flesh" he is referring to God taking on humanity through Jesus, This means
              that Jesus eternally one with God (John 1:1-2) and reveals the Father to us as the only begotten Son
      
      - The god and true man: the church explains that Jesus inseperably true God and true man, 
        He is truly the Son of Godwho, without ceasing to be God and Lord, became a man and our brother
      
      - The doctrine of incarnation is clearly teaching Christians to embrase a life of humility, 
        obedience and generous imitation of Jesus Christ
      - The sacramental representation and application of Christ's sacrifice on the cross
