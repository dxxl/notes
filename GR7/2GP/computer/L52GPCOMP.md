### DATA AND VARIABLES
            * DATA = a collection of facts and items of information
                   = defined as raw facts or figures, then it becomes information
            
      * DATA TYPES:
            * STRING: a collection of characters that can include letters,
                      numbers , special characters, etc.

                      In Javascript, strings usually represent text, Strings
                      can be included in the Javascript code by enclosing them
                      by either single or double

            * NUMBER: Two Types: INTEGERS (whole numbers)
                                 FLOATING-POINT NUMBERS (fractional)

            * BOOLEAN: This data type can be only have two values, True and
                       and false

            * NULL: nothing here, this can also be the result as an error

      * VARIABLE: a container of data in the computer's memory
            >> WAYS:
                  / DECLARING THE VARIABLE [EX. var height]
                  / CREATING THE VARIABLE IN A FLY [EX. height = 20;]

            >> RULES:
                  * Variable names can contain uppercase letter, lowercase
                    characters or a mixture of both

                  * Variable names can not contain spaces and special characters
                    except for the underscore

                  * The first character can not be a digit.

                  * WE cant use reserve names

            * prompt() = displays a dialog asking the user to enter data
                         [Ex. prompt("textsh*t", "your name"); ]
                         can also be:
                         [Ex. prompt("no","")]

            >> BUILT IN VARIABLES:
                        > document.bgColor \\ 
                        > document.fgColor
                        > window.status
