### FABRIC
      - beings with fiber, with the plants and animals
      - There are also fibers created from chemicals
      - means a woven material, a textile or other materials

            A. NATURAL FIBERS
                  > There are four basic fibers:
                        - cotton - cotton plants 
                        - linen - plants
                        - wool - sheep
                        - silk - it comes from silkworms

            B. Synthetic Fibers
                  > OTHER SYNTHETIC FABRICS:
                        - Aetate
                        - Acrylic
                        - nylon
                        - polyester
                        - Dacron-Dacron

      - TEXTILES = Means "to weave", refers to fabrics that are woven
                 = made in three different ways

                        - WEAVING:  can be made on a machine called loom

                        - KNITTING: is done by interlocking loops from a single yarn

                        - MATTING:  are made using synthetic fibers, they can be formed
                                    like paper into cloth material instead of using a 
                                    weaving process, hence the term nonwoven

                  * HOW TO TEST?
                        = Stretch recovery
                        = wrinkling 

                  * MOST COMMON TYPES OF TEXTILE WEAVES
                        > PLAIN = This is the simple basic weave using the warp and the 
                                  weft threads interlacing an over and under pattern
            
                                = most of them are chifons, plantens (?), and yeah askjd

                        > TWILL = Twill weave effect is made by weaving one of more warp
                                  fibers over and under one or more weft fibers

                        > SATIN = The satin weave has a very smooth, shiny surface due to
                                  the effect of the weft threads that seem to float over 
                                  the warp yarn :
