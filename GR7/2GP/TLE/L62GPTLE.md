### THE SEWING MACHINE PROBLEMS + SOLUTIONS
            * THREAD BREAK?

              There can be several reasons for the same but the most likely reason for
              the problem is the tension, thread quality and the needle type

            * MACHINE IS NOISY

              When you hear an unusual weird noise, stop sewing, You should immediately
              stop the sewing machine and investigate where the sound is coming from

            * BALANCE WHEEL STOPPED OR DOES NOT TURN

              This hand wheel is mostly used to bring the bobbin thread up though the
              needle plate and to raise/lower the needle for position for changes/pivoting
              just put oil

            * IF THE DRIVE WHEEL DOES NOT ROTATE

              It is connected to the balance wheel by a leather band, thus transmitting the
              power which operates the machine

            * LOOPED STITCHES

              Sometimes you start to get loose or loopy stitches as you stitch or stitches
              when you use the sewing machine after a long time

            * THE SEAM IS WRINKLED

              This problem generally occurs when you have an old sewing machine

            * THE NEEDLE BREAKS

              It clearly happens when the needle is not attached right away to the needle 
              bar

            * SKIPPING STITCHES

              WHen the needle is used for a long time, its tip ('point' end of the needle)
              tends to become dull that results in skipped stitches

            * STITCHES ARE IRREGULAR

              This is yet another common problem that sewist face in most cases, its the
              sewing machine needle again that causes thisp problem

            * LOWER THREAD BREAKS

              As you tighten the regulator it pulls the tension discs closr creating high
              tension for the thread passing through the tension disc
