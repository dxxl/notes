### ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS
      - we'll just translate words to algebraic expressions and equations
      - an algebraic expression contains constants and variables along 
        with +, -, x, /, or

      - a variable is a symbol used to represent an unknown number
        a symbol is a letter, a constant is a number except for
        coefficients

      - A constant has a definite value Coefficient are numbers 
        multipled to a variable </3
            - i am a number dating a letter (coefficient) 

      - EX.  5x - 3
           the coefficient is 5x because its near a variable, it can change like your mental sanity,
           the constant is alone tho, like you at 1 am

      - big letters symbols, smol for variables
      - if the coefficient is 1, dont put 1
      - you can only use the fusion technique in letters and numbers, not numbers x numbers
      - than = switch positions
