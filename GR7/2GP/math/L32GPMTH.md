### history of length/devices that measure length
      * LENGTH - is the measure of distance between any two points
               - is the process of measuring the distance between any two points
               - An ancient times, people used to measure the length with the help of body parts, such as outstretched palm, foot, arm-length (cubit)
               
      HISTORY: The first ruler was a measuring rod made of copper alloy and it dated from 2650 BC
             : Measuring rod was found by German Assyriologist Eckard Unge
      
      INSTRUMENTS: The first folding ruler was invented by Anton Ullrich
                 // First flexible ruler was made in 1902
                 // Rulers come in different shapes, sizes and materials, Some of that materials.

                 * DESK RULER // The best known and most common type of ruler
                              // are generally used for measruing, drawing straight lines and as guides

                 * STEEL RULE // is a straight flat piece of metal, very similar to ruler
                              // are flexible and rigid

                 * MACHINIST RULER // looks like a very much like an ordinary ruler. But it enables you to measure an object accurately
                                   // often used by mechanics

                 * YARDSTICK AND METED STICK // are straight thin pieces of wood or metal used to measure objects

                 * FLEXIBLE RULER // is made of bendable material for measuring uneven surfaces
                                  // often used by masons and perfect for work that requires precision
                 * HOOK RULER // measurement instrument for joinery and general layout work
                               // contains a fixed rigid hook
                 * ROLLING PARRALEL RULER // combines a protactor, ruler and template available for students, teachers, artists
                 * PROTRACTOR // Used to measure angles or circles
                 * DRAFTING TRIANGLE // usually made of clear plastic
                                     // used to draw anglular and vertical ones
                 * SEAMSTRESS TAPE
                 * CURVED RULERS // They are another essential tool used in sewing and dressmaking industry
                                 // 
                 * L-SQUARE // ..

### HISTORY OF VOLUME
      - the amount of space occupied by a liquid at rest or their containers
      - was an historical base measurement unit for all types of fliuds, granual solids and objects, Early civilizations used standard measuring pottery to measure volume, the Amphorae were used as units of volume.
      - Measuring cups: a literal kitchen utensil or a regular labaratory utensil used to measure different types of liquids // are used to measure washing power, liquid detergents and bleach for clothes washing
      - Beakders: a cylindrical contain with a flat bottom, are available in a wide range of sizes from one mililiter up to several liters, is distinguished from a flash 
      - Graduated Cylindrs: also known as a measuring cylinder or mixing cylinder is a common piece or labaratory equipment
      - Flasks: are vessls or containeres that fall into the category of labaratory equipment known as glassware, they come in a number of shapes and a wide range of rizes but a common distinguishing aspect
      - Syringes - used for injections or to precisely measure oral medications are calibration in mililiters (mL) also known as cc (cubic centimeters) as this is the standard unit of medication
