### History of measurement [originally written in 11-17-21]
      * CUBIT - was the first recorded standark line of measurement, Defined by the distance from the tip of the forefinger to the middle of the elbow // This was first used by the Egyptians for building pyraminds (2750 BCE)
      * HAND - The cubit subdivided into several other measurements, One hand is measured with the fingers closed and from the end of thumb to the other end of the palm
             \\ 1 hand = 4 inches * 101.6 mm
      * FOOT - History believes that the foot was given its name from thehuman part(?), the length of a human foot was measured from the heel to the tip of the big toe // From Egyptians through the Greeks and romans to present day, the length of one foot has increased considerably // This is caused by the use of the foot in building and as time developed, the use of measureing with boots on foot has increased the size of one foot
             \\ 1 foot = 12 inches = 304.8 mm

      *** HISTORY OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS 
            1799 - French revolution and the subsequent deposition of two platinum standards representing the meter and the kilogram on June 22, 1799, in the archives de la Republique in paris 
            1832 - Gauss (?) promoted using the "metric system" cm  Guass was the first to make absolute measurements of the earth's magnetic force in terms of a decimal systembased of the three mechanical units: milimeter, gram and second for, respectively, the quantities "length, mass and time"
            1860/1960 - Maxwell and Thomson further developed Gauss' work through the British Association for the advancement of science (BAAS), They formulated the requirement for a cocrent system of units with base units and derived units
            1874 - BAAS introduced the centimeter-gram-second (COS) system, a three dimensional concrent unit system based on the three mechanical units centimeter, gram and second, using prefixed raging from micro to mega to express decimal submultiples and multiplies the following development of physics as an experimental science was largely based on this system
            1880 - BAAS added the ONON (?) for electrical resistenace, the volt of electromotive force and the amere for electric current in conjunction with internation Electrical Congress
            May 20 1875 - After the establishment of the meter convention, the International Comittee for weight and measures (ICPPM) concentrated on the construction of new prototypes taking the meter and kilogram as the base units to seven

      NOTE: The moie(?) is officially defined as "the mass in grams at this amount of a substance" numerically equal to the molecular weight of the substance


> EDITOR'S NOTES:
1. There are parts with "(?)", it means that It isnt sure that if it is the correct one or not
2. These notes may or may not be what we will encounter tomorrow, the original's teacher isnt the same with ours so we might get another pov of the lesson
3. These notes are pirated and contacting other sections for notes, especially if they have a different teacher and they're way ahead of us is a big deal
