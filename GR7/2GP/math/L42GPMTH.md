### THE METRIC SYSTEM
            * The metric system is a measurement system based on the powers of 10
            * UNITS
                  1. Meter - length or distance [m]
                  2. Gram - mass [g]
                  3. Liter - volume [L]

            * METRIC UNITS:
                  The metric system has prefix modifiers that are multiples of 10
                        Kilo  = K           = 1000
                        Hecto = h           = 100
                        Deca  = da or dk    = 10 [we use da]
                        Unit  = m, l, or g  = 1
                        Deci  = d           = .1 [1/10]
                        Centi = c           = .01 [1/100]
                        Milli = n           = .001 [1/1000]

                  Ex. dag = decagram, dam = decameter
                  Note: Deca = 10, Deci = .1 or 1/10

      ** CONVERSION OF UNITS
            To change from a larger unit to a smaller unit, you go right 
                  1 km x 1000 = 1000 m
                  1 km x 100 = 100 cm
                  1 cm x 10 = 10 dam

            To change back, we go left
            note:  K H D U D C H
