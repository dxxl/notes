### radicals: principal roots and approximating  roots
      radicals = expressions containing radical symbols. This is the opposite of exponents
            * Parts
                  - Radical sign (its like a division sign)
                  - index (small number outside the radical sign)
                          (tells you what root you are looking for)
                          (if it has no index, use 2 and above)
                          (these are always positive)
                  - radicand (number inside the radical sign)
                             (this is to extract)
            * Application
                  - this is used in capentry, masonry, and engineering
      * Principal roots
            - the principal square root is the POSITIVE ROOT of a nonnegative number
            - give the positive number if principal root is being asked
      
### estimating square roots
      1. Examine the units digit, this will give you a clue about the last digit of the square root
      2. drop the last two digits, this will give you a clue about the first digit of the square root1
      3. combine uwu

### approximating roots
      - you cant get this, you never will :)
      - uh approximate (like 17's square root is 4 and 5)
