### SCIENTIFIC NOTATION
      - is a method of writing very large and very small numbers using powers of 10
      - number is expressed in scientific notation when it is in the form 
            // a x 10n (10 is constant, it will never go away)
                  // Where "a" is between 1 and 10 and "n" is an integerz
                  // right = -, left = +
                  // structure = a x 10^n

      - how to turn: 
            * move "a" until the number is BETWEEN 1 and 10
            * count the number of digits and that will be "n"
            * write it in this structure: a x 10^23

      - how to go back to DN:
            * + = R
              - = L
            * its reversed
