### history of length/devices that measure length
      * LENGTH - is the measure of distance between any two points
               - is the process of measuring the distance between any two points
               - An ancient times, people used to measure the length with the help of body parts, such as outstretched palm, foot, arm-length (cubit)
               
      HISTORY:
            The first ruler was a measuring rod made of copper alloy and it dated from 2650 BC
            Measuring rod was found by German Assyriologist Eckard Unge
      
      INSTRUMENTS:
                The first folding ruler was invented by Anton Ullrich
                       // First flexible ruler was made in 1902
                       // Rulers come in different shapes, sizes and materials, Some of that materials.

                 * DESK RULER // The best known and most common type of ruler
                              // are generally used for measruing, drawing straight lines and as guides

                 * STEEL RULE // is a straight flat piece of metal, very similar to ruler
                              // are flexible and rigid

                 * MACHINIST RULER // looks like a very much like an ordinary ruler. But it enables you to measure an object accurately
                                   // often used by mechanics

                 * YARDSTICK AND METED STICK // are straight thin pieces of wood or metal used to measure objects

                 * FLEXIBLE RULER // is made of bendable material for measuring uneven surfaces
                                  // often used by masons and perfect for work that requires precision
                 * HOOK RULER // measurement instrument for joinery and general layout work
                               // contains a fixed rigid hook
                 * ROLLING PARRALEL RULER // combines a protactor, ruler and template available for students, teachers, artists
                 * PROTRACTOR // Used to measure angles or circles
                 * DRAFTING TRIANGLE // usually made of clear plastic
                                     // used to draw anglular and vertical ones
                 * SEAMSTRESS TAPE
                 * CURVED RULERS // They are another essential tool used in sewing and dressmaking industry
                                 // 
                 * L-SQUARE // ..
