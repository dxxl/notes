### MASS
      -    It identifies how much matter is in an object
      -    WEIGHT = it is the amount of heaviness of an object or organism

      DEVICES:
            1. GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTION
                  for enormous objects in space, scientists rely upon gravitational 
                  interaction of the object in question with nearby objects

                  To determine the mass of a star, you need to know the distance
                  between it and another star and the time of their respective
                  movements

            2. SPACE LINEAR ACCELERATION MASS MEASUREMENT DEVICE (SLAMMD)
                  A more sophisticated mass measuring device, the SLAMMD measures
                  the in-orbit mass of humans on board of the International Space
                  Station, SLAMMD is a rock-mounted device that relies on Sir Isaac
                  Newton's Second Law of Motion, whereby force equals mask times 
                  acceleration

            3. WEIGHT SCALE
                  This is a device to measure weight or mass, These are also known
                  as mass scales, weight scales, mass balances, and weight balances
                  The traditional scale consists of two plates or bowls suspended at
                  equal distances from a fulcrum, The perfect scale rests and neutral
