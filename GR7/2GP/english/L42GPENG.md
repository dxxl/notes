                      of a poem, The form may also guide the purpose and tone of a poem, When the
                      message and form fit together, you can produce a poem that is truly powerful
                      Poet Matsuo Basho once said "In my view a good poem is one in which the form
                      of the verse and the joining of its parts seem light as a shallow river following
                      through"
