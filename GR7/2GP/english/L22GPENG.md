### CONJUNCTIONS
      - a joiner/connector
      - a word like "and, but, although, because, etc." // Conjunctions have an important function because they join other word and phrases together, without conjuctions, we could only make very, very simple sentences
      - CLAUSE // INDEPENDENT CLAUSE = Can stand alone, is literally independent
               // DEPENDENT CLAUSE = Cannot stand alone without an independent clause, literally depends on the other

            * 3 BASIC TYPES
                  - COORDINATING - A coordinating conjunction joins parts of a sentence (for example words or independent caluses) that are grammatically equal or similar // FANBOYS acryonm (FOR,AND,NOR,BUT,OR,YET,SO)

                        * FOR - indicates person // Ex. I am willing to support you for i want is the best for you
                        * AND - CONNECTS RELATED ITEMS OR SHOWS THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS. //
                        * NOR - for two non-contrasting grammatically negative items (not + not) // Ex. He doesn't eat cake, nor does he biscuits
                        * BUT - for contrast (yes + no) // Ex. He liked other subject, but English was the one special subject for him
                        * OR - indicates alternatives only one of which can be true 
                        * YET - Contrats, despite something [nevertheless, but, still] // He's overweight, yet he continues to eat alot of cakes and biscuits
                        * So- indicates result // His opponents were also very talented, so he practiced a lot to be very best

                  - SUBORDINATING - joins a subordinate (dependent) clause to a main (independent) clause
                                  - Always comes at the beginning of a subordinate clause, It "introduces" a subordinate clause, However a subordinate clause can come after or before a main clause

                              * SUBORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS
                                    > Comparison [than, rather than, whether]
                                    > Time [after, as soon as]
                                    > Concession [although, though]
                                    > Relative pronouns [Whoever, whom]
                                    > Reason [Because, since, so that]
                                    > Condition [if, if only. unless]
                                    > Place [Where, wherever]
                                    > Relative Adjectives 
                                    > Manner [How, as though, as if]
                                          
                                    EXAMPLES: I would like to eat at home rather than in an expensive restaurant
                                            : After my graduatioin, I will take the Licensure Examination for Teachers

                  - CORRELATIVE - are pairs such as neither-nor, not only- and but also, These conjunctions connect two balanced caluses, phrases, or words. The two elements that correlative conjunctions connect are usually similar in length and grammatical structure
                              * CORRELATIIVE CONJUNCTIONS
                                    > Either-Or: Used if there are two options // Ex. Let us go either for the cricket match or for the football match
                                    > Neither-nor: uses same function for negative, [not + not] // Ex. Neither she nor her husband wanted to live together anymore
                                          NOTES: When we user either or neither, the verb agrees with the second subject, NOT the first
                                               : When neither-nor is used to lnk two independent claues, negative inversion (the reversal of the positions of subjject and auxilary verb must be used.
                                               : In general, whenw e join two singular subjects with a correlative Conjunction, the verb that follows should be singular

                                    > Not only-But also: We use Notonly-Butalso to give emphasis on an additional element in the sentence // Ex. The house is not only large but also beautiful, Not only did she wash did she was the clothes but she also iron them
                                          Note: When "not only" is used to start an independent caluse, as in the second exampple there is a negative inversion as in the cause of neither-nor, WHen but begiins the second independent caluse, the subject comes in between "but" and  "also"

                                    > Both-and: We use "both-and" to emphasis on two elements that are true in the sentence // The house is both big and beautiful
                                    * PUNCTUATION: When we use a corrleative conjunction to join two independent clauses, we seperate the two caluuses with a comma
