  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            * PERIOD OF APPRENTICESHIP/IMITATION
                  - the years 1910 - 1925 as a period of novices with their exercises in fiction-making and the rise of the new language
                  - this is from Virginia R. Moreno's "A critical study of the shorty story in English Written by Filipinos
                  > "As a period of novices with their exercises in fiction-making and the rise of the new language"
                        - one of the best contribution to the american regime is english writting

                  > "The filipino writers imitated American and English writers"                  
                        - This fact is hardly surprising since teh early writers were Filipino teachers apprenticed by the Americans college students or young graduates whose literary education had been largely confined to American and English Authors
                  
                  > TWO SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
                        - Poems are amateur and mushy, the diction or the use of words are artificial and awkward
                        - in 1925 A.V.H Hartendorp became the editor-publisher of the Philippine Education Magazine, This soon became the Philippine Magazine, the most influencial literary magazine of its time

                        - The Manila tribune was estasblished in the same year. It began publishing a Sunday supplement featuring original short stories and poems written in English. Other journals followed and there was a market, although, still very limited, for Filipino literary output in English
