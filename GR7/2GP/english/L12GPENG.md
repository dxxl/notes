# COLONIAL PERIOD
      - The philippines has been either a country or a puppet state
      - this lasted for 200 years
            * SPAIN = 1565 -> 1898
            * THE UNITED STATES = 1898 -> 1941
            * JAPAN -> 
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            * PERIOD OF APPRENTICESHIP/IMITATION
                  - the years 1910 - 1925 as a period of novices with their exercises in fiction-making and the rise of the new language
                  - this is from Virginia R. Moreno's "A critical study of the shorty story in English Written by Filipinos
                  > "As a period of novices with their exercises in fiction-making and the rise of the new language"
                        - one of the best contribution to the american regime is english writting

                  > "The filipino writers imitated American and English writers"                  
                        - This fact is hardly surprising since teh early writers were Filipino teachers apprenticed by the Americans college students or young graduates whose literary education had been largely confined to American and English Authors
                  
                  > TWO SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
                        - Poems are amateur and mushy, the diction or the use of words are artificial and awkward
                        - in 1925 A.V.H Hartendorp became the editor-publisher of the Philippine Education Magazine, This soon became the Philippine Magazine, the most influencial literary magazine of its time
                              - Abraham Van Heyningen Hartendrop, commonly known as A.V.H Hartendorp or A.V Hartendor was an American Writer, editor, Thomasite and Filipinologist.

                        - The Manila tribune was estasblished in the same year. It began publishing a Sunday supplement featuring original short stories and poems written in English. Other journals followed and there was a market, although, still very limited, for Filipino literary output in English

                        PROSE             |     POETRY

                  * ELEMENTS OF POETRY:
                    INTRODUCTION: A poet is limited in the materials he can use in creating his works
                        1.  They must sound right to the listener, even as they delight his ear
                        2.  They must have a meaning which might have been unanticipated
                        3.  They must be arranged in a relationship and placed on the page in ways that are once easy to follow
                        4. They must probe the depths of human thought, emotion and empathy, while appearing simple, self-contained, and unpretentious

                  ---------------------------------
                  I. RHYTHM: This is the music made by the statemenets of the poem, which includes the syllables in the lines
                  II. METER: This is the basic structural makeup of the poem, every line in the poem must adhere to his structure. A poem is made up blocks of lines, which convey a single strand of thought, Within those blocks, a structure of syllables which follow the rhythm has to be included. This is the meter of metrical form in poetry
                  III. STANZA: is defined as a smalled unit or group of lines, or a paragraph in a ppoem, A particular lstanza has a specific meter, rhyme scheme.
                             : Based of the number of lines, stanzas are named Couplet (2 lines) Tercet (3 lines) etc..
                  IV. RYHME: the last words of the lines match with each other
                           : basically similar soundiing words like "cat" and "hat" "close and shows" "house and mouse" and etc.
                           : Free verse poetry doesnt follow this system.
                  V. RHYME SCHEME: defined as the pattern of the rhymes
                                 : denoted like the alphabets "ABAB" or "AABB"
                                 : if used all, use "[letter]'"
                  VI. THEME: The topic of the poem.
                           : could be a story, a song, a desc of someone, etc.
                  VII. SYMBOLISM: Convery ideas using symbols, A symbol can stand for many things at one time and leads the reader out of a systematic and structured method
                  VIII. IMAGERY: used by the poet for readers to create an image in their imagination
                               : appeals to all the five senses, for ex. when the poet describes 'the flower is bright red' an image of a red flower is immediately created in the reader's mind.
