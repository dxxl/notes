### MICROORGANISMS

* BACTERIA [KINGDOM MONERA]
      - Types: 
      * SHAPE
               Coccus (Circular)
               Bacillus (Rod-shaped)
               Sprillium (spiral shaped)
      * ARRANGEMENT:
               Strepto (chain)
               Staphylo (Cluster)
               Diplo (pair)        
      * GRAM STAIN = a staining technique for the prelimary identification of bacteria, in which a violet dye is applied, followed by a decolorizing agent then a red dye, The cell walls of certain bacteria (denoted gram-positive) retain the first dye and appear violet, while those that lose it (denoted gram-negative) appear red, Also called "gram's method"
                  = 90-95% of Gram negative bacteria are pathogenic, on the other hand, many Gram-Positive bacteria are non-pathogenic

* FUNGI
      - Eukaryotic (with membrane-bound organelles)
      - non-photosynthetic - unlike plants
      - Most are multicellular
      - Most are microscopic molds or yeasts
            (the study of fungi is known as mycology)

      YEASTS      | MOLDS AND MUSHROOMS
      unicellular   multicellular

      - Fungi that decompose dead plant and animal matter = saprophytes, they act as recyclers of dead organic matter, obtaining food from this material

* VIRUS
      - an infectious biological particle consisting of a nucleic acid as a genetic material and a protein coat called "capsid"
      - Are OBLIGATE INTRACELLULAR PARASITES, meaning they cant live on their own, they dont posses the characteristics of life
      - Are considered to be acellular, meaning they do not contain nor made up of cells

* PROTISTS
      - defined by what they are NOT
      - Eukaryotes that are not plants, animals or fungi
      - Scientists believe they were the "1st eukaryotic organisms"
      - most are unicellular (algae exception)
      - many are "aquatic"
      - very diverse kingdom
      - Heterotrophic organisms
            - Distinguished by how they move:
                  1. Flagella: long "tail-like structure
                  2. pseudopods: "false feet" extensions of cytoplasm
                  3. Cilia: tiny "hair like" structures beat in unison
                  4. some immobile
