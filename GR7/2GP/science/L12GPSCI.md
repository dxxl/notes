### CELL STRUCTURE
      - are the smallest units of an organism
      - they have 3 types in common
            - have a cell membrane
            - dna
            - other thing mentioned
            - All cells have a cell membrane..

            * CATEGORIES
                  - Eukaryotic Cells
                        - Are advanced and complex cells
                  - Prokaryotic Cells
                         - are unicellular
                         - they have Genetic materiall
                         - always 1 cell (like bacteria)
            * ORGANELLES
                  * NUCLEUS
                        - Contains DNA
                        - the nucleous contains nucleous
                   * CELL WALL
                       - The cell wall is a rigid and strong organelle composed of cellulose and fiber.
                       - It functions as the support and protection of the cell
                       - Animals dont have a cell wall
                   * CELL MEMBRANE
                       - The cell membrane is selectively permeable so that it allows food, water, and gasses, to enter and wastes to leave the cell
                       - It also serves as a barrier between the cell and its enviroment and maintains homeostatsis
                   * CYPPTOPLASM
                       - is a clear, thick and jelly-like material that contains the organelle found inside the cell membrane
                   * ROUGH ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM
                       - is an organelle embedded with ribosomes and ius used for protein synthesis
                       - consists of tubes and membranes which serve as passages of substances that go through the cell
                   * Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum
                       - Is an organelle without ribosomes
                       - aids in lipid synthesis and cell detoxification
                       - similar to the RER, it is also composed of tubes wherein substances go through the cell
                   * Ribosomes
                       - the ones responsible for synthesizing protiens- nutrients which allow the cell to perform chemical reactions
                   * Centriole 
                       - Is a barrel-shaped organelle found only in animal cells
                       - helps in the process of cell division 
                       - is typically made of nine sets of microtubules
                   * Mitochondria
                       - Known as the "powerhouse of the cell"
                       - a large amount of energy and carbon dioxide is release here
                   * Vacoule
                       - is a membrance-bound sac that stores food, water, metabolic and toxic wastes in the cell
                   * Lysosomes
                       - known as "suicide bags" 
                       - break down food molecules and old cell parts
                   * Chloroplast
                       - an organelle only found in plants
                       - used to produce energy needed by plants to produce their own food 
                   * Golgi Apparatus
                       - known as the packaging site of the cell
                       - an organelle which receives proteins and lipids and packages them with carbohydrats before sending them outside the cell
                   * Cilia
                       - tiny hair like organelles which move the cell or the substances around the cell
