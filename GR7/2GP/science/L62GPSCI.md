            * ABIOTIC = Physical Factors- Nonliving things \\\
                      = include water, pressure, soil, sunlight, etc. 
      
            * KINDS OF INTERACTION
                  A. Biotic- Biotic: living interacts with the living
                  B. Biotic- Abiotic the non-living interacts with the living
                  C. Abiotic- Abiotic the non-living interacts with the non-living
