### SEXUAL AND ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION
      1. What is sexual and asexual reproduction?
      2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of sexual and asexual reproduction?

            *** REPRODUCTION: is the ability to produce new individuals is one of the characteristics that distinguish living things from non-living things // to make new life // "important for the prepetuation of species"

                        ** TYPES: SEXUAL AND ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION
                              ASEXUAL -  Is the creation of a new organism from a single or one parent, and does not involve the combination of gamates or sex cells // The offspring looks like parent // The genetic make up of the offspring is the same as the parent
                                    Examples: Bacteria, Protist, Animals, PLants, Fungi
                                          ADVANTAGES
                                                > The organism does not need to search for a partner
                                                > It requires less energy since no mater is needed
                                                > It takkes only a short period of time
                                                > Produces Many offspring at one reproductive cycle
                                          DISADVANTAGES
                                                > No Variation in the genetic makeup of the offspring
                                          WAYS OF ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION
                                                * FISSION
                                                * BUDDING
                                                * SPORE FORMATION
                                                * FRAGMENTATION
                                                * REGENERATION
                                                * VEGETATIVE PROPAGATION 

                              SEXUAL - males prodce sperm cells and female with egg cells, if these unites, the process is called fertilization, then zygote, then embryo, then a fucking baby // other organisms are fungi, plants and animals

                                          ADVANTAGES:
                                                > Creates variation
                                          DISADVANTAGES:
                                                > Requires a partner
                                                > requires more energy
                                                > The rate of reproduction is slower
