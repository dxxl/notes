### TYPES OF ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION
      * SPORE FORMATION
            - is a type of asexual reproduction where organisms reproduce by forming SPORES
            - are carried by air usually, examples are mushrooms, molds and ferns
            - spores are single cell reproductive thingys that come from mushrooms and other plants
      * BUDDING
            - a new organism is formed from a outgrowth from a parent
            - corals, yeasts, hydras and jellyfish are the examples
      * FISSION
            - an organism and duplicated its genetic dna
            - it means "to divide"
            - sea anemoni (i thought amoeba, nvm it is), and bacteria are examples
      * FRAGMENTATION
            - happens when new organism grows from a fragment of a parent
            - examples are planarian, flatworms and starfish
      * REGENERATION
            - when a body part is detached from the parent, This part grows and develops into a completely new individual
            - this happens usually after fragmentation, its not a reproduction since no new organism has been formed
      * VEGETATIVE PROPOGATION
            - is a method wherein new plants are obtained from the parts of old plants like stems, roots, and leaves without the use of any reproductive parts.

                  * TYPES OF VEGETATIVE PROPOGATION
                        - Runners/Stolon  = an above ground stem that grows horizontally along the surface when the stem touches the ground
                        - Rhizomes = an underground stem that grows horizontally along the surface
                        - Tubers = are enlarged and thickened underground stem with buds or eye
                        - Bulb = have a short, underground stem and thick fleshy leaves that are colorless, A bulb can reproduce several smaller bulbs
                        - Corm = is an enlarged short, underground stem that stores food, Corms resemble bulbs but do not have thick, fleshy leaves
