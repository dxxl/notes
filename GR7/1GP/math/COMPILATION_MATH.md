# SETS
      - A set is a well defined or celarly described collection of objects, things, or symbols
      - The objects in a set is called elements

* SET NOTATION
      - refers to how sets can be named or identified
      - are denoted by capital letters (A, B, Z, X, etc.) 
      Note: for the elements, use small letters

      These things can be expressed using:
      * ROSTER METHOD
            - all elements of the set are listed enclosed within a pair of braces and seperated by commas
            Ex. X = {2,4,6,8}
                Z = {h,a,i,r}
      * SET BUILDER NOTATON
            - method of writing a set by descrbiing its elements
            Ex. A = {x/x is an even bumber LESS than 10}
                B = {x/x is a Grade 7 student in SSA for SY 2021-2022}

      * CARDINALITY OF SETS
            - is the number of elements in a set and it is denoted as | |. A set with zero cardinality is called an EMPTY SET
            - SYMBOLS: {} = EMPTY
            - empty sets are also called "null sets"

# L1GPA-MATH.md [POWER SETS]
      - is the set of of all the subsets of a given set, the number of subsets is determined by the formula "2n"
      - (to further understand what the formula "2n" is, "n" is the number of elements in said set, basically saying "2 by the power of [how many elements in the set])
               
      * UNIVERSAL SETS AND VENN DIAGRAMS
            - The universal set is a general set that contains all elements under discussion (to make it simple, its equal to the words in word bank)
            - John Venn created the venn diagram to show the relationships between sets
            - anything inside the set is part of the set

      * REPRESENTING TWO SETS IN A DIAGRAM
            * DISJOINT SETS = Two sets with nothing in common
            * EQUAL SETS = Is atleast equal to something
            * PROPER SUBSETS = all sets of set a is also in set b

      * COMPLIMENT SETS
            *' = The symbol of compliment
            * is a part of the universal set but isnt in a set (basically, its an extra)
                  Ex. U = {3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30}
                      B = {3,6,9,21,27}
                      B'= {12,15,18,24,30}

      * INTERSECTION AND UNION OF SETS
            - The intersection is basically the common elements between set A and set B
            - The union is the combination of both sets A and B                       
            
            * INTERSECTION EXAMPLES:
                X = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}
                Y = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12}
                COMMON: {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10}

            * UNION EXAMPLES:
                X = {2,4,6,8}
                Y = {1,3,5,7}  
                UNION = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}              
            
            * If there is none, use an empty set

      * DIFFERENCE OF SETS  
            - it is defined as, if we have two sets "A and B" then A - B is the elements of A which are not in B
            - basically "A - B" is "elements of A that are NOT in B" and vice versa   
             
      * OTHER THINGS TO KNOW:
            - Set operations and Venn diagrams provide precise ways of organizing, classifying, and describing the vast array of sets and subsets we encounter everyday.
            - "or" = union of sets
            - "and" = intersection of sets

# L21GPMATH.MD [REAL NUMBERS]
      * Real Numbers
            - Rational and Irrational numbers combined
            - These have two categories: Rational and Irrational
      ==============================================================
            * RATIONAL CATEGORY
                  I. Natural Numbers/Counting Numbers
                        - uses "N"
                        - the other term for this is "counting numbers"
                        Ex. 1 2 3 4 
                  II. Whole Numbers
                        - Uses "W"
                        - This time, it includes all the numbers, from 100 to infinity
                        - the only difference between whole and natural is that in Whole, it starts with zero, while in Natural/Counting, it starts with 1
                  III. Integers
                        - Uses "Z"
                        d- Unlike whole numbers and counting numbers, these things have negatives, like "-1, -20"
                  IV. Rational
                        - Uses "Q"
                        - Every number is rational, but not all rational numbers are integers, whole numbers or natural numbers
                        - These include decimals, fractions.. and more, but these must be expressed easily, if not, they're in the irratioal category

            * IRRATIONAL CATEGORY
                        - Uses "P"
                        - These children can't be expressed easily, like pi or square root of 2 (no really what is equal to getting 2?)

# L41GPMATH.md [INTEGERS]
      * VOCABULARY AREA
            * Integer = everything but with negatives like -1,-10, etc.
            * Opposites = Two same numbers with different values
            * Number line = a literal line that shows both 
            * Absolute value = a number's distance from zero on the number line (always a positive value) 
              Ex of Opposites. 12, -12

      * numbers less than zero are negative integers
            * negatives are written with a "-" sign
      * integers greater than zero are positive integers
            * positives can either be written without a "+" sign or with
      * Zero is neither a positive or negative number, call it a bystander in situation where you have to side with someone

      * ABSOLUTE VALUE
            - the distance of some number from zero
            - this thing is always positive, dont you dare make it negative, you'll be wrong
            
# L51GPMATH.md [ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF INTEGERS]
      * ADDITION RULE
            * IF SIGNS ARE THE SAME:
                  - ADD and keep the sign
                  Ex. -13 + -5 = -18
            * IF SIGNS ARE DIFFERENT:
                  - SUBTRACT and use the sign that has the bigger number

      * SUBTRACTION RULE
            * Subtracting is doing addition, but you have to do KCC first [KEEP-CHANGE-CHANGE]
            Ex. [-5] - [-2] 
                 -5  +  2 = [-3]

# L61GPMATH.md [MULTIPLY AND DIVIDE INTEGERS]
      * MULTIPLICATION RULE:
            * Whenever we multiply two integers with "like" signs, the answer is always positive
            * Whenever we multiply two integers with "unlike signs", the answer is always negative

            * An expression with an even number of negative integers will always produce a POSITIVE answer
            * An expression with an odd number of negative integers will always produce a NEGATIVE answer

      * DIVIDING RULE:
            * we just multiply here
            * Whenever we divide two integers, with like signs, the answer is always positive
            * Whenever we divide two integers, with unlike signs, the answer is always negative

            * An expression with an even number of negative integers will always produce a POSITIVE answer
            * An expression with an odd number of negative integers will alywas produce a NEGATIVE answer 

# L71GPMATH.md [RATIONAL NUMBERS]
      * Rational numbers are in the form a/b where A and B are integers and B is not 0
      * The root word for rational is ratio
            - Ratios are fractions
      * Any number that can be written as the quotient (a fraction) of two integers is a rational number, However, the denominator cannot be 0
      * -6 is a rational number because it can be expressed as a quotient  of two integers
      * 0.25 is a terminating decimal, This type of decimal terimates and does not repeat, it can be converted into a fraction
      * 0.333.. is a repeating decimal, this type of decimal repeats, just from the name, it can also be written as a fraction

      * CHANGING FRACTIONS TO DECIMALS
            * METHOD 1: DIVIDE THE NUMERATOR AND DENOMINATOR
            * METHOD 2: By having a denominator that is a power of 10
      * CHANGING DECIMALS TO FRACTIONS
            * CASE 1: NON-REPEATING/TERMINATING DECIMALS
                  - "0.25" in this case, 25 becomes the numerator and the deno is the current place it is in, which is the hundreths
            * CASE 2: REPEATING DECIMALS
      
# L81GPMATH.md [ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF FRACTIONS]
      * CASE 1: SIMILAR FRACTIONS
            - In adding and subtracting similar fractions, simply add or subtract the numerators and copy the denominator, If the answer is not in its simpliest form, then find its lowest
      * CASE 2: DISSIMILAR FRACTIONS
            - In adding 

# L91GPMATH.md [MULTIPLY AND DIVIDE FRACTIONS]
      * MULTIPLYING FRACTIONS
            - In multiply fractions, simply multiply the numerators and the denominators. If the answer is not in lowest term, then convert it to lowest terms
      * DIVIDING FRACTIONS 
            - In dividing fractions, you need to get the reciprocal of the divisor, Change division to multiplication and simply multiply
            - reciprocal is just the flipped version of the fraction
