#Compound

- Pure substances made up of more than one element
- 2 or more elements chemically combined
Ex. H2o, NaCI
- Unlike elements, compounds can be broken down into simplier forms
- The properties of the elements that make up a compound are often quite different from the properties of the compound itself
Ex. Sodium-Na = highly reactive metal
    Chlorine-Ci = Poisonous gas
---->  Sodium chloride-NaCl = table salt

* Compounds have categories
      Organic
      - Produced by living things
      - all contain carbon
      - Important organic compounds
         - Carbs
         - Liquids   
      Inorganic 
      - Non-living things
      - Do not contain carbon (expections)
      - Needed for life
      - Plants organize inorganic compounds into organic
            * H20, 02, C02
      - Minerals, nitrates

*Molecules
      - Combination of two or more atoms chemically bounded
      - Water - 2 atoms of hydrogen and 1 atom of oxygen
- A molecule is the smallest particle of a compound that has all the properties of that compound
- just as all atoms of a certain element are alike, all molecules of a certain compound are 

Molecule examples: A water molecule (H2o)
                   A carbon dioxide molecule (Co2)
                   An Ammonia molecule (NH2) (?)

* Chemical Formulas
- A shorthand way of representing compounds
- IF chemical symbols are the "letters" these are the "words"
Ex. NH3 - ammonia
- Sometimes, the formula represents a molecule of a single element

* Subscripts
- Are small numbers used in chemical formulas
- they are placed to the lower RIGHT of the chemical symbols
- Represent # of atoms of an element in a compound

Ex. CO2 = 1 atom of carbon, 2 atoms of oxygen
    H2SO4 = 2 atoms of hydrogen, 1 atom of sulfur, and 4 atoms of oxygen
