# Levels Of Biological Organization
      - is comprimised of different organisms, spanning from plants, animals, to minute bacteria
      - In order to coexist, the ecosystem of these life forms must be balanced.
 
## THE LEVELS
1. Cell
      - is the basic unit of structure and function of living things
      - It serves a specific function for each organism
      - all organisms are ccomposed of one of more cells.
      Ex. Blood Cells, Epithelial Cells, Neurons, and others
2. Tissue
      - Made of cells
      - Are similar in structure and functions work together to perform a specific activity
      - Human beings have four basic tissues:
            -> Connective
                  - Wraps around and cushions and protects organs
                  - internal support for organs
                  - As tendon and ligaments protects joints and attached..
            -> Epithelium
                  - Protects us from the outside world || skin
                  - absorbs || stomach and intestinal lining (GUT)
            -> Muscular
                  - responsible for muscle movement
                  - responsible for mechanical digestion
                        - Skeletal
                              - the one attached to the skeleton
                        - Cardiac
                              - strongest muscle in the body
                        -  Muscle 
                              - Voluntary muscle for movement
            -> Nervous
                  - Impulses to and from body organs
3. Organ
      - Consists of tissuesm
      - group of tissues of the same structure 
      - Like cells and tissues, organs function to perform a specific activity alongside other organs in the body
      Ex. The Heart, The Veins, The arteries (these are examples of organs that are responsible for blood circulation)

4. Organ System 
      - A group of organs that work together for a specific function
      - composed of the heart, veins, arteries, and capillaries, add the digestive system and other systems like the nervous system

5. Organism
      - Is an individual that can carry out all basic life processes
      - an take in materials, release energy from food, release wastes, grow, respond to the enviroment, and reproduce

            - Are classified into two, MULTICELLULAR AND UNICELLULAR
                  1. MULTICELLULAR
                        - are made up of various cells with specialized functions
                  2. UNICELLULAR
                        - Are composed of only one cell
                        - Ex. Bacteria, and some protists
6. Population
      - a group of individuals of a given species that live in a specific geographic area at a given time
7. Community
      - consists of groups of population in a specific area at a given time, It includes populations of organisms of different species

8. Ecosystem
      - includes more than a community of living organisms (BIOTIC), interacting with the enviroment (ABIOTIC)
      - living organisms depend of other abiotic factors such as rocks, water, air, and temperature
      Ex. Tropical rainforest

9. Biome
      - consists of various ecosystems that have common characteristics
      Ex. An aquatic biome
10. Biosphere
      - when all different biomes are considered, each blending into one into the other, with humans living in many different geographic areas we form a huge community of humans, animals, and plants in their defined habitats
      - A biosphere is the sum of all of this
