# SCIENTIFIC METHOD
      - is an organized way to solve a particular problem

### THE PROCESS OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD
      * Initial Observation of a phenomenon
      * Problem/Question
      * Formulation of a Hypothesis to explain the Phenomenon
      * Actual Investigation and Data Gathering
      * Conclusion and Application of Results

1. Observations
      - Process In which one gathers information using the senses-sight, hearing smell, taste, and touch or feeling
            * TYPES OF THINGS TO OBSERVE:
            ==============================
                  - QUALITIATIVE DATA
                        - Deals with Descriptions
                        - Data can be observed but not measured
                        - Colors, textures, smells, tastes, appearance, beauty, etc.
                        - QUALITative = qualities of said thing
            ==============================
                  - QUANTITATIVE DATA
                        - Deals with numbers
                        - Data which can be measured
                        - Length, volume, Height, Area, Weight, Speed, Time, Temperature, Humidity, Sound, Levels, Cost, Members, Ages, etc.
                        - QUANTITative = quantity of said thing
            ==============================
2. Problem/Question
      - Develop a question or a probelm that can be solved through experimentation
=============================================================================
3.  Formulation of a Hypothesis to explain the phenomenon
      - Hypothesis is a tentative explanation for the phenomenon you have observed
      Ex. is soil temperatures rise, then plant growth will increase
=============================================================================
4. Actual Investigation and Data gathering (Experimentation)
      - Experimentation is defined as an organized method used to test a hypothesis. You must design experiments to gather new information
      - In an experiment, always consider your VARIABLES
            ==============================
                  * 3 KINDS OF VARIABLES
                        * INDEPENDENT VARIABLE (MANIPULATED VARIALE)
                              - Factor that can be adjusted by the researcher in the experiment
                        * DEPENDENT VARIABLE (RESPONDING VARIABLE)
                              - Factor that changes because of the independent variable
                        * CONTROLLED VARIABLE (CONSTANT)
                              - Factor that remain unchanged in the experiment
            ==============================
5. Evaluation of Results and Data Verification
      - Modify the procedure if needed, Confirm the results by retesting, Include tables, graphs, and photographs
=============================================================================
6. Conclusion and Application of Results
      - Include a statement that accepts of rejects the hypothesis
      - Make recommendations for further study and possible improvements to the procedure.
