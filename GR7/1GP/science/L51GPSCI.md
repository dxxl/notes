# Matter
- Anything that has Mass and Volume
- It has 5 states

* 5th state: Bose-Einstien Condensate (BEC)
- done by cooling atoms to temp. one millionth of a dregree aove absolute zero, whichh is millions of times colder than the lowest temp. found in the depth of the outer space

- Gas -> Liquid -> Crystalline Solid
- Crystalline -> liquid -> Gas 

* And here is sublimation who doesnt like liquid <0>
      - Solid -> Gas
* Also Deposition that hates liquid
      - Gas -> Solid

* Pure Substance
- Components are chemically combined
- DO NOT retain their original properties
- CANNOT be seperated by Physical or ordinary means
- The composition is FIXED
- Made up of only one type of stance
- has definite properties

* Mixture
- Physically combined
- RETAIN their original properties
- CAN be seperated by physical or ordinary means.
- the composition is VARIABLE
- Made up of 2 or more substances
- Shows the properties of its components

# Types of mixtures
** Heterogeneous mixtures
- Can see thhe different parts of the mixture
- Liquids are unstable and will settle up
Ex. Pizza. Oil

** Homogeneous mixtures
- Can NOT see the different parts of the mixture
- Solutions
- Liquids are stable and typically wont settle
Ex. Alloys, Salt water, etc.

      * Solutions
            - Settle upon standing = no
            - Seperate = no
            - Particle Size = 0.1-1 nm
            - Scatter light = no

            - Made up of solute and solvent
                  Solute = the thing
                  Solvent = the one that will disolve the thing
                  Ex. Milk in tea
      * Colloids
            - Settle upon standing = No
            - Seperate = No
            - Particle size = 1-100 nm
            - Scatter light = Yes

            - Types of Colloids
                  - Sol 
                        - Dispered phase = soild
                        - Dispersion medium = Liquid
                  - Emulsion
                        - liquid
                        - liquid
                  - Soild Sol
                  - Solid Emulsion
                  - Solid Foam
                  - Soild Aerosol
                  - Liquid Aerosol
      * Suspension
            - Settle upong standing = Yes
            - Seperate = Yes
            - Particle size = 100 nm >
            - Scatter light = Yes
