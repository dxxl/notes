# MICROSCOPE
- a tool that is used to see organisms or objects that are too small to be seen
* THINGS THAT CAN BE SEEN IN THE MICROSCOPE: Plant Cells, Viruses, etc. 

* MAGNIFICATION: describes the size of a small thing, basically zooming on
* RESOLUTION: The capacity of a microscope to distinguish small gaps 

* COMPOUND MICROSCOPE: It uses light to magnify things
                       It uses two or more double convex lenses
## PARTS OF A MICROSCOPE
* MAGNIFYING PARTS = The parts that make the specimen look bigger
* ILLUMINATING PARTS = To give light
      * MIRROR =  ...
      * IRIS DIAPHGRAM = ...
      * STAGE CONDENSER = collects and focuses

* MECHANICAL PARTS = I also didnt get stuff here wtf
      * Adjusting knobs
            A. Ill never know
* EYEPIECE = the magnification is 10x
      * OBJECTIVE LENSES = The major lenses used
            A. LOW POWER OBJECTIVE
            B. HIGH POWER OBJECTIVE
            C. OIL IMMERSION OBJECTIVE

## TYPES OF MICROSCOPES
* Light Microscopes
      - Visible light is passed through the specimen
            * Lenses: refract light (imagine is magnified)
            * can magnify effectively to about 1000x the side of the actual specimen
* Electron Microscope
      - 1950's cell biology increased its limits
      - focuses beam of electron microscrope
            * TYPES OF MICROSCOPE
            - Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
                  - 100,000x magniification
            - Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
                  - Detailed study of the surface of the specimen
                  - can magnify and create 3d version of cells
            - Scanning Probe Microscope
                  - can visualize objects as small as atoms through computer generation
            

## THINGS TO REMEMBER IN USIING THE MICROSCOPE
      1. Carry the microscope with your both hands
      2. Put the microscope down gently on the labatory table with its arm facing you.
            - Place it about 7 centimeters away from the edge of the table
      3. Check the microscope before and after use
      4. Use a clean tissue paper or soft cloth like t-shirt to clean the mechanical parts of the microscope
      5. Use only a special lens paper to clean the lenses.
      6. Prevent liquids, especally acids and alcohol from spilling on any part of the microscope
      7. Check for moisture in the eyepiece
      8. Acoid tiltinig the microscope while observinig wet mounts
      9. Never store the microscopes in a chemical laboratory or any place where there are corrosive fumes
      10. Keep your microscope in its box when not in used
      
## VIEWING THE SPECIMEN
      1. Put The slide on the stage
            - Always start with the low power objective
      2. Watching it on the side, carefully lower the body tube until the end of the LPO almost touches the cover slip
      3.Look through the eyepiece, Slowly turn the course adjustment upwards to raise the objective until the letter "e" appears
      4. To shift to the HPO, raise the body tube first, looking from the side, turn the revolving nosepiece to put the HPO in pace
      5. When the HPO is already inplace, using the fine adjustment slowly lower the objective till it almost touches the cover slip.

COMPUTE ACTUAL MAGNIFICATION =
