# LT 1 REVIEWER SCIENCE (1GP)

ORIGINAL AUTHOR: Darshiki/Ash (Rori's online alias)

THINGS TO NOTE IN THIS FILE AND OTHER REVIEWERS:
1. The notes are revised, meaning they look different from the seperate ones I sent you back then, this is the same with other reviewers
2. Making these things are time consuming and require fact checking with both my notes and the teacher's slides so please be patient!

#### Scientific Method [L1GPSCI.md]

I. Observation
- Process in which one gathers information using the senses-sigh, hearing, smell, taste and touch or feeling

Qualitative Data
- Deals with Descs.
- Data can be observaed

Quantative Data
- Deals with Numbers
- Numbers are observed

II. Problem/Question
- Develop a question or problem that can besolved through experimentation
III: Formulation of Hypothesis
- theories

IV: Actual Investigation and Data Gathering (Experimentation):
- Expermentation is defined as an organized method to test things

- all experiments should have a control group
- Constant - variables that are not changed in an experiment
- Trials - Tests

Variables: 
* Independent variable (manipulated variable) 
      - What i change
* Dependent
      - the one we observe
* Controlled
      - will remained variable

** Fair test is important in this scientific observation

V. Evaluation of Results
- we evaluatie the results of the said experiment

VI. Conclusion and Application of Results
- aslasfaks 

CAUTION!!
Effect - a noun
Affect - A verb

#### Observation and Inference [L21GPSCI.md]

- you note a fact using our 5 senses
- has two kinds: qualitative and quantitative
- an observation is a fact
- can be easily determined by looking at it

Ex. Describe a hamburger
1. It looks big
2. its contents are delicious
3. I can imagine that it smells good

- you can start guessing 
- we can recommend thiings, which is what we call inferences
- assumptions (are inferences)

Ex. 
the burger doesnt taste good so i infer that you should cook the steak better

1. the table looks messy
2. the dog is standing there
3. the woman is thinking

#### Elements and Compounds [L31GPSCI.md]

- At the time, there are only 4 elements
      - Earth
      - Fire
      - Water
      - Air
- there are currently 118 elements that have been identified though only 88 of them are present in the universe
- in our universe, hydrogen makes up 75% of all matter!
- Helium makes up 20% and oxygen being the 3rd most abundant element
* (so 1. Hydrogen, 2. Helium, 3. Oxygen) 
- All of the other elements are relatively rare in the universe

* Elements in the Earth
- In the Earth's crust, oxygen is the most abundant element (46.6%)
- Silicon is the most second abundant element (27.7%)

* Elements are pure substances
- Made of only one kind of material, has definite properties and is the same all throughout

* Elements are the simplest pure substance
- they cannot be broken down into simpler subtances without losing their identity

- The smallest particle of an element has the properties of that element that is called an atom
- atoms: the building blocks of matter
- Atoms of the same element are alike; atoms of different elements are different

- An element is a substance made up of only one type of atom
Ex. Copper is an element made up of copper atoms only
    Carbon is an element made up of carbon atoms only
    Helium is an element made up of helium atoms only

* Atom Parts
- Neutron
      - nucleus
      - neutal charge
- Proton
      - nucleus
      - positive charge
- Nucleus 
      - in the middle of an atom
- Electrons
      - Around the atom
      - negative charge

* Representation of chemical symbols
- Shorthand way of representing the elements.
- Usually one or two Letters
- Usually taken from the name of the element

Ex. Carbon - C, Calcium - Ca, Hydrogen - H

* Other Chemical symbols
- Sodioum - Na
- Potassium - K
- Iron - Fe
- Copper - Cu
- Silver - Ag
- Gold - Au
- Mercury - Hg
- Antimony - Sb
- Tin - Sn
- lead - Pb
- Tungsten - W

** Mass number (p+ + n0)
** Atomic number (p+)
** Atomic symbol
      - subtract the atomic mass with the atomic number to get the neutrons
      - Atomic mass is always higher :)

* Elements groupings
    - most of the elements are metals
      * Metals 
            - are solid stuff
      * Non-metals
            - basically air
      * Metalloid
            - can have non-metal and metal characteristics
#### Compound [L41GPSCI.md]

- Pure substances made up of more than one element
- 2 or more elements chemically combined
Ex. H2o, NaCI
- Unlike elements, compounds can be broken down into simplier forms
- The properties of the elements that make up a compound are often quite different from the properties of the compound itself
Ex. Sodium-Na = highly reactive metal
    Chlorine-Ci = Poisonous gas
---->  Sodium chloride-NaCl = table salt

- Compounds have categories
      Organic
      - Produced by living things
      - all contain carbon
      - Important organic compounds
         - Carbs
         - Liquids   
      Inorganic 
      - Non-living things
      - Do not contain carbon (expections)
      - Needed for life
      - Plants organize inorganic compounds into organic
            * H20, 02, C02
      - Minerals, nitrates

*Molecules
      - Combination of two or more atoms chemically bounded
      - Water - 2 atoms of hydrogen and 1 atom of oxygen
- A molecule is the smallest particle of a compound that has all the properties of that compound
- just as all atoms of a certain element are alike, all molecules of a certain compound are 

Molecule examples: A water molecule (H2o)
                   A carbon dioxide molecule (Co2)
                   An Ammonia molecule (NH2) (?)

*Chemical Formulas
- A shorthand way of representing compounds
- IF chemical symbols are the "letters" these are the "words"
Ex. NH3 - ammonia
- Sometimes, the formula represents a molecule of a single element

*Subscripts
- Are small numbers used in chemical formulas
- they are placed to the lower RIGHT of the chemical symbols
- Represent # of atoms of an element in a compound

Ex. CO2 = 1 atom of carbon, 2 atoms of oxygen
    H2SO4 = 2 atoms of hydrogen, 1 atom of sulfur, and 4 atoms of oxygen

#### PART 2 OF L41GPSCI.md [This is considered as L51GPSCI.md in my files]
Notes from author: this isnt the full contents of the file, in fact, the contents of the file is just explanation on what matter is so i disregarded it for its not part of the pointers

* Pure Substance
- Components are chemically combined
- DO NOT retain their original properties
- CANNOT be seperated by Physical or ordinary means
- The composition is FIXED
- Made up of only one type of stance
- has definite properties

* Mixture
- Physically combined
- RETAIN their original properties
- CAN be seperated by physical or ordinary means.
- the composition is VARIABLE
- Made up of 2 or more substances
- Shows the properties of its components

# Types of mixtures
** Heterogeneous mixtures
- Can see thhe different parts of the mixture
- Liquids are unstable and will settle up
Ex. Pizza. Oil

** Homogeneous mixtures
- Can NOT see the different parts of the mixture
- Solutions
- Liquids are stable and typically wont settle
Ex. Alloys, Salt water, etc.

      * Solutions
            - Settle upon standing = no
            - Seperate = no
            - Particle Size = 0.1-1 nm
            - Scatter light = no

            - Made up of solute and solvent
                  Solute = the thing
                  Solvent = the one that will disolve the thing
                  Ex. Milk in tea
      * Colloids
            - Settle upon standing = No
            - Seperate = No
            - Particle size = 1-100 nm
            - Scatter light = Yes

            - Types of Colloids
                  - Sol 
                        - Dispered phase = soild
                        - Dispersion medium = Liquid
                  - Emulsion
                        - liquid
                        - liquid
                  - Soild Sol
                  - Solid Emulsion
                  - Solid Foam
                  - Soild Aerosol
                  - Liquid Aerosol
      * Suspension
            - Settle upong standing = Yes
            - Seperate = Yes
            - Particle size = 100 nm >
            - Scatter light = Yes
