# ELEMENTS AND COMPOUNDS

- At the time, there are only 4 elements
      - Earth
      - Fire
      - Water
      - Air
================================================
* ELEMENTS
      - there are currently 118 elements that have been identified though only 88 of them are present in the universe
      - in our universe, hydrogen makes up 75% of all matter!
      - Helium makes up 20% and oxygen being the 3rd most abundant element
            * (so 1. Hydrogen, 2. Helium, 3. Oxygen) 
      - All of the other elements are relatively rare in the universe

* Elements in the Earth
      - In the Earth's crust, oxygen is the most abundant element (46.6%)
      - Silicon is the most second abundant element (27.7%)

* Elements are pure substances
      - Made of only one kind of material, has definite properties and is the same all throughout

* Elements are the simplest pure substance
      - they cannot be broken down into simpler subtances without losing their identity

      - The smallest particle of an element has the properties of that element that is called an atom
      - atoms: the building blocks of matter
      - Atoms of the same element are alike; atoms of different elements are different
      - An element is a substance made up of only one type of atom
            Ex. Copper is an element made up of copper atoms only
                Carbon is an element made up of carbon atoms only
                Helium is an element made up of helium atoms only

* Atom Parts
      - Neutron
      - nucleus
      - neutal charge
======================
* Proton
      - nucleus
      - positive charge
=======================
* Nucleus 
      - in the middle of an atom
=======================
* Electrons
      - Around the atom
      - negative charge
=======================

* Representation of chemical symbols
      - Shorthand way of representing the elements.
      - Usually one or two Letters
      - Usually taken from the name of the element
            Ex. Carbon - C, Calcium - Ca, Hydrogen - H

* Other Chemical symbols
      Sodioum - Na
      Potassium - K
      Iron - Fe
      Copper - Cu
      Silver - Ag
      Gold - Au
      Mercury - Hg
      Antimony - Sb
      Tin - Sn
      lead - Pb
      Tungsten - W
------------------------------------------------
      * Subtract the atomic mass with the atomic number to get the neutrons
      * Atomic mass is always higher :)
      * The atomic mass is the protons

** Elements groupings
      - most of the elements are metals
** Metals 
      - are solid stuff
** Non-metals
      - basically air
** Metalloid
      - can have non-metal and metal characteristics
