 2. Elements of a Story (L21GPENGLISH.md)

3. Subject-Verb Agreement (L31GPENGLISH.md)

- a sentence can be divided into two parts: the subject and the predicate
- It is easier to look for the ber first, since every sentence must contain a verb
- the verb can be an action or a linking verb

 Subject
- indentifies the topic of the sentence. It tells us what the sentence is about

 Predicate
- the part of a sentence or clause containing a verb and stating something about the subject

Linking Verb
- links the subject and the predicate

! SV AGREEMENT RULES
1. When the subject of a setnece is composed of two or more nouns or pronouns connected by and, use a plural verb.
Ex. She and her friends **are** at the fair

2. When two or more singular nouns or pronouns are connected by or or no, use a singular verb
Ex. The book or the pen **is** in the drawer

3. When a compound subject contain both a singular and a plural noun or pronoun join by or or nor, the verb should agree with the part of the subject that is nearer the verb
Ex. The boy or his friends **run** every day

4. Doesnt is a contraction of does not and should be used only with a singular subject, Don't isnt a contraction of do not and should be used only with a plural subject. 
The exception to this rule appears in the case of the first persson and the second person I and you, with thesse prounouns, the contraction should be used
Ex. He **doesnt** like the food 
  .  I **don't** like you

5. Do not be misled by a phase that coimes between the subject and the verb. The verb agrees with the subject, not with a nounce or pronoun in the phase
Ex. The people who listens to that music are few

6. The words each, each one, either, neither, everyone, everybody, anybody, anyone, nobody, somebody, someone, and no one are singular and requires a singular verb.
Ex. "Everybody knows Mr. Jones"

7. Nounds such as civics, mathermatics, dollars, measles, and news require singular verbs
!! The world "Dollars" is a special case, when talking about an amount of money, it requires a singular verb, ut when referring to the dollars themselves, a plural verb is required!!

Ex. Five Dollars is alot of money (uses singular)
    Russian dollars are pog (uses plural)

8. Nounds such as scissors, tweezers, trousers, shoes, and shears require plural verbs. !!there are two parts to these things!!
Ex. I have scissors, you can borrow them
9. in sentences Beginning with "there is" or "there are", the subject follows the verb, Since "there" is not the subject, the verb agrees with what follows.
Ex. There are many questions !question/s is the subject!
    There is a question

10. Collective nounds are words that imply more than one person but are considered singular and take a singular verb, such as group, team, committee, class, and family
Ex. The team runs during pratice (the team is a subject, a collective noun)

11. Expressions such as with, together with, including, accompanied by, in addition to, or as well, do not change the number of the subject, 
If the subject is singular the verb is too
Ex. The president, **accompanied by his wife**, is traveling to india (accompanied by is just an addition)
