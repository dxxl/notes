THINGS TO NOTE IN THIS FILE AND OTHER REVIEWERS:
1. The notes are revised, meaning they look different from the seperate ones I sent you back then, this is the same with other reviewers
2. Making these things are time consuming and require fact checking with both my notes and the teacher's slides so please be patient!

#### Pre-colonial times Language [L11GPENGLISH.md]

#### Elements of a story [L21GPENGLISH.md]

* Fiction
- is literature created from imagination, not presetned as fact though it maybe based on a or situation, it can be a exaggeration

* Elements
** Characters
- refers to the people in the story

* Types of Characters
PROTAGONIST - The hero who takes the stand for the good
ANTAGONIST - Plays againist the heroic character and tries to stop them
DYNAMIC - undergoes significant change throughout the story
STATIC/FLAT - does have strong characteristics but doesnt reveal much
ROUND - acts subtly and changes in the face of conflict, said character becomes complex as the story progresses as they dont just stick to their limited qualities

* Plot
- It refers to the way the actions are arranged in the story
* Plot Can be arranged in three ways
      A. LINEAR [CHRONOLOGICAL] - consists of a series of events that have a clear beginning, middle and end
      B. CIRCULAR [LINEAR WITH FLASHBACKS] - non-linear plot that progresses more or less chronologically similar to the one at the beginning of the story
      C. IN MEDIAS RES - narrates a story from the middle after supposing that the readers are aware of past events

* Five major parts of Plot
1. Exposition - beginning of story
2. Rising Action - Events before climax
3. Climax - the turning point
4. Falling Action - actions and stuff that happen after the climax
5. Resoultion - end of story, unless there's a sequel

#### Subject-verb Agreement [L31GPENGLISH.md]
- a sentence can be divided into two parts: the subject and the predicate
- It is easier to look for the verb first, since every sentence must contain a verb
- the verb can be an action or a linking verb

* Subject - topic of sentence
* Predicate - the one the sentence is talking about
* Linkng verb - links subject and predicate

* RULES
1. When subject of a sentence is composed of two or more pronouns connected by "and", use a plural verb
Ex. She and her friends ARE at the fair

2. When two or more singular nouns or pronouns are connected by "or" or "nor", use a singular verb
Ex. The book or the pen IS in the drawer

3. When a compound subject contains both a singular and a plural noun or pronoun joined by "or" or "nor", the verb should agree with the part of the subject that is **nearer the verb**
Ex. The boy or his friends RUN every day

4. Doesnt = does not and should be used with a singular subject, Don't â‰  do not and should be only used with a plural subject, unless if it has to do with first or second person
Ex. He DOESNT like the food :( 
.   I DONT like you

5. Do not be misled by a phrase that comes between the subject and the verb, the verb agrees with the subject, not with a noun or pronoun in the phrase
Ex. The people [who listen to that music] ARE few
[] = phrase

6. The following Words: "Each, each one, either, neither, everyone, everybody, anybody, anyone, nobody, somebody, someone, no one" are **singular** and REQUIRE a singular verb
Ex. EACH of these hotdogs (is) juicy
() = verb

7. Any nouns that look plural but are actually singular in meaning REQUIRE singular verbs
Ex. The news IS at six 

7.1 Dollars is an exception, when talking about the amount of money, it requires a singular verb, but when its referring to the dollars themselves, a plural verb is needed
Ex. Ten dollars IS alot of money (this is the amount of money condition)
    Dollars ARE often used instead of rubles in Russia (this is the dollars itself condition)

8. Nouns that are pairs require plural verbs
Ex. These scissors ARE dull

9. In sentences that start with "there is" or "there are" the subject follows the verb
Ex. There ARE many questions
    There IS a question

10. Collective nouns are words that imply more than one person, but those things are considered SINGULAR and take a singular verb in this case
Ex. The team RUNS during practice
    The family HAS a long history

11. Expressions suchh as "with, together with, including, accompanied by, in addition to" or "as well" DO NOT CHANGE the number of the subject
Ex. The President, accompanied by his wife, IS travelling to India

#### Prosodic Features of Speech [L41GPENGLISH.md]
